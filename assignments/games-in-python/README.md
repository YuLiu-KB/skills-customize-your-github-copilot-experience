# 📘 Assignment: Games in Python

## 🎯 Objective

Build engaging games using Python to practice string manipulation, loops, conditionals, and user input handling. By completing this assignment, you'll gain confidence in combining multiple programming concepts to create interactive entertainment programs.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Hangman Game

#### Description
Create the classic word-guessing game where players try to guess a hidden word letter by letter before running out of attempts. This project will help you practice working with strings, managing game state, and creating an engaging user experience.

#### Requirements
Your completed program should:

- Randomly select words from a predefined list of at least 10 words
- Display the word as underscores initially (e.g., "_ _ _ _ _" for a 5-letter word)
- Accept single letter guesses from the player
- Show correct letters in their proper positions when guessed
- Track and display the number of incorrect guesses remaining
- Prevent players from guessing the same letter twice
- End the game when the word is fully guessed (win) or attempts are exhausted (lose)
- Display appropriate win or lose messages with the correct word revealed
- Ask if the player wants to play again


### 🛠️ Number Guessing Game

#### Description
Build a fun number guessing game where the computer picks a random number and the player tries to guess it with helpful hints. This will reinforce your understanding of loops, conditionals, and user input validation.

#### Requirements
Your completed program should:

- Generate a random number between 1 and 100
- Prompt the player to guess the number
- Provide helpful feedback ("too high", "too low", or "correct!")
- Count and display the number of guesses taken
- Handle invalid input gracefully (non-numbers, numbers outside range)
- Congratulate the player when they guess correctly
- Offer to play another round
